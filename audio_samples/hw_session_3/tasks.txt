1. Think of a possible application for audio analysis/synthesis from your personal environment (private or business). Describe the task to be solved and possible solutions. 
2. Make yourself familiar with the code for the HMM (’pra_sw03-code-snippet.py’). Choose one model and explain the trained values of A, B and π with help of a state chart. Run a decoder for different observations and analyse the outcome. 
3. Define a HMM λ =(A,B,π) for an additional symbol, e.g. '!' by hand, i.e. without training. Tipp: draw a state chart first. Adapt the code and test it. Explain your solution in a concise way. 
4. How could a predefined start and stop state be enforced? Adapt the code therefore.
5. Investigate the effects of the parameters, as number of states, number of iterations for training, …. How do these influence the performance of the detection system?
