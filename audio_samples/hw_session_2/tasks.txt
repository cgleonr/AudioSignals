1. Download and open Praat. Record yourself saying these words naturally: heed, hid, hayed, head, had, hud, hard, hawed, hood, who’d (one word per recording, can use google to help with pronunciation if unknown). 
2. In Praat, measure the first two formant frequencies (F1 and F2) for each vowel. Create a vowel plot with F1 on the vertical axis and F2 on the horizontal axis to visualize your own vowel space. Bonus: what does F3 tell us about a vowel?
3. Explore the audio file you recorded in the time and frequency domain. Look out for features that could be specific to your recording. 
4. Prepare drawings explaining the features according to 3. Describe what makes your recording unique.
5. Think of an algorithm to identify your recording basing on some features described. Implement your algorithm roughly in Python and validate its selectivity with respect to the features chosen. 
6. Post all results (vowel analysis, graph, drawings, code, test results) to the mailbox on Ilias.
